# Emotion Classifier Using NLP üß†

[Webapps Deployment](https://huggingface.co/spaces/achmaddhani/Emotion_Classification)

## Objective üéØ

Mental health is a vital aspect of our well-being, yet it is often overlooked or misunderstood. Our project aims to provide validation and reassurance to individuals by employing advanced NLP machine learning techniques. With high accuracy, our model classifies emotions üåà, offering affirmation and potentially brightening someone's day by showing they are not alone in their feelings.

## Project Overview üìñ

This project uses NLP and machine learning to accurately classify emotions based on text input. The goal is to help individuals understand and validate their emotional experiences through the power of shared experiences and empathy.

## Dataset and EDA üîç

- The dataset is well-curated, featuring balanced classes for different emotions.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) indicates that most people express their feelings concisely.
- Common words associated with joy include "life," "good," "day," while "would," "even," "angry" often appear in expressions of anger.
- Fear expressions are more complex, often involving words like "still," "bit," "strange."

## Model and Performance üíª

- The core of the project is an LSTM network with a 93% accuracy rate.
- Preprocessing includes the use of stop words to reduce noise and improve learning patterns.
- Future improvements involve adding more stopwords and expanding the dataset to include a broader range of emotions.
